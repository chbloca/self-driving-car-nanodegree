# basic_lane_lines_detector
Lane lanes are inferred by outputting left and right projection lines estimations

This project is part of Udacity Self-Driving Cars Engineer nanodegree.

Input: Image

Output: Projection of left and right inferred lane lines

It is a limited implementation because it only works properly for linear lanes.
